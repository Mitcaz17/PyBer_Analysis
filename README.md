# PyBer_Analysis
# Overvie of the analysis

The purpose of this assignment is to show us how to gather the appropiate data from CSV file. After gatherin all the data, we have to place it an a proper graph so its easier to read.


# Results

As per the graph we gather we can see the two spectrums. In more rural areas the ride sharing app is cheaper becuase of a lower demand on it. While in urban areas the service is more expensive due there being more demand. 

# Summary

In my opion the CEO should do these three things. Provide discounts for those living in rural areas so they would be more willing to use the service. Increase workers and app support for those using it in urban areas. Provide a car pool servicies on those suburban areas since transportantion might be more difficult.
